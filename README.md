## Branching Strategy

### Git Flow

Branches in Git Flow:
master: Contains the production-ready code. Each commit on master represents a stable, deployable state.

develop: This is the integration branch for ongoing work. All features are merged here before being released to production.

feature/\*: Feature branches are used to develop new features or bug fixes. These are created from the develop branch and merged back into develop when complete.

release/_: When develop is ready for a release, a release/_ branch is created to prepare the code for production. This branch allows for last-minute bug fixes, documentation updates, or version number changes.

hotfix/\*: These are emergency fixes made directly to master (or main). After the fix, the changes are merged into both master and develop to ensure consistency.

### Flow Example:

Start with master and develop.
Create a feature/ branch from develop.
Merge the feature back into develop.
When ready for a release, create a release/ branch from develop.
Merge release/ into both master and develop.
For urgent fixes, create a hotfix/ branch from master, fix, then merge into both master and develop.
