## Branching Strategy

### Git Flow

Branches in Git Flow:

1. master: Contains the production-ready code. Each commit on master represents a stable, deployable state.

2. develop: This is the integration branch for ongoing work. All features are merged here before being released to production.

3.feature/\*: Feature branches are used to develop new features or bug fixes. These are created from the develop branch and merged back into develop when complete.

4. release/_: When develop is ready for a release, a release/_ branch is created to prepare the code for production. This branch allows for last-minute bug fixes, documentation updates, or version number changes.

5. hotfix/\*: These are emergency fixes made directly to master (or main). After the fix, the changes are merged into both master and develop to ensure consistency.

### Flow Example:

1. Start with master and develop.
2. Create a feature/ branch from develop.
3. Merge the feature back into develop.
4. When ready for a release, create a release/ branch from develop.
5. Merge release/ into both master and develop.
6. For urgent fixes, create a hotfix/ branch from master, fix, then merge into both master and develop.
